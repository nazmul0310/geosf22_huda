    "1. Create four empty lists for different temperature classes. Please use **exactly** the same class names for the list variables as provided above (`cold`, `slippery`, `comfortable`, and `warm`). You can create an empty list with the code: ```emptyList = []```.\n",

    "    * a.) How many times was it slippery during the study period?\n",
    "    * b.) Was it ever warm during the study period?\n",

    "# C. Temperature Calculator (Functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "During one of the lesssons, we have worked with functions converting temperature values from degree Celsius. The code for this and two other temperature conversion functions are given in the code snippet file `./Lecture08/TempCalculatorSnippets.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet contains function to convert temperature units from degree Celsius to Fahrenheit, from Kelvin to Celsius and from Kelvin to Fahrenheit. Using provided code for temperature unit conversions, write a more **universal `tempCalculator` function that accepts temperatures in Kelvins and returns either Celsius or Fahrenheit**. Make use of the functions provided in the code snippet file. You can call functions from functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the python code file 'tempCalculator.py’ (see code cell below).\n",
    "2. Create a new function `tempCalculator`, which accepts two parameter:\n",
    "    - `tempK` = parameter receives temperature values in units of degree Kelvin\n",
    "    - `selection` = determines whether to output should be in Celsius or in Fahrenheit (using letters `C` or `F` accordingly)\n",
    "3. Write the function so that it converts and returns temperature values from Kelvin to either Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on the value it receives for the second argument. A selection is needed for this. Also, make use of the functions provided in the code snippets to perform the conversions, instead of rewriting the same equations. For that, the provided functions should be called from the new function `tempCalculator`.\n",
    "4. Add the docstring provided in the code snippet file at an appropriate position in the `tempCalculator` function.\n",
    "5. In the code cell defining the `tempCalculator` function, define the following variables in a way so they become **global** variables for the notebook (you have two multiple syntax choices for this, choose any that works):\n",
    "    - tempFreezeK = 0\n",
    "    - tempFreezeC = 0\n",
    "    - tempFreezeF = 32\n",
    "6. Set these global variables as default values for the arguments of the `tempCalculator` function.\n",
    "7. Test/Apply the calculator for once with passed values, once for default values.\n",
    "8. Call the help() function for the calculator. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- coded function with two input and one return arguments\n",
    "- coded selection for different temperature units\n",
    "- default arguments are set to receive values of the correctly defined global variables for freezing points\n",
    "- call the provided functions from the new function `tempCalculator`\n",
    "- added the docstring and comments in the code\n",
    "- called the tempCalculator for two examples and applied the help function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data / Code\n",
    " \n",
    "In the code cell below, uncomment and use the magic command `%load` to load the content of the python code snippet into the code cell below (simply uncomment the code line and execute the cell).\n"
