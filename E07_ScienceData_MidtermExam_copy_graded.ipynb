    "The data analysis above have given many elements of thought regarding the population trend over the next 80 years. Estimated population of 2020 is 7.79 billion and the predicted population in 30 years, in 2050 is 9.73 billion. Approximate jump of 2 billion people in less than 30 years. The total population prediction for 2100 is 10.88 billion and comparing with 2050 it is not as steep as of a change comparing with prior 30 years. That means the population growth is predicted to be slowed down. It is also evident from a few countries' data where the growth even declines to negative, resulting less population in coming days. This is also evident with the percent change values calculated for two different time windows, 1. 2020 ~ 2050 & 2. 2020 ~ 2100. Almost 25% change in the next 30 years and in next 80 years the change is around 40%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis also shows which countries will have the highest number of population in coming days. In 8 years, India China and Unites States of America will have the highest number of population. This information will be helpful to make different policies and changes to existing ones to proper utilize population resources. Also, China although still a country with huge number of population is seeming to be slowing down around the end of this century. With the global change trend, analysing the data for individual country gives the perspective of where one country stand comparing with the rest of the world. USA seems to be on par with the global chnage trend as the the change will be 31% increase and the global average is 40%. Australia si also having a similar growth but more than the USA. Australia also invites a lot of immigrants and that might be a factor for their growth. China, as mentioned earlier is slowing down rapidly and the population will be 25% less than what it is now, this suggests that China has many ongoing measure to prevent their population growth problem. India, France, Turkey all will see moderate to no change in population rise. For a country like India, 4% growth is a very low number as the past trent used to be muich steeper. Brazil, also a country with large population is also reucing the population by 15%. Nigeria is facing one of the worst population growth problems as it will be facing a 255% increase and it is often seen in the countries of Africa. Egypy will be doubling up in population. Worst of all, Niger will see a rise in population of 6 times more than what the population currently is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the average of change in individual countries summed up, shows a different value which is pretty close to the calculated global change together. The average of individual countries suggest all the countries on average facing 50% growth but we have also seen that the major contributor to the world population, China, Brazil, India are all slowing down. That means the countries with lower population now will increase in numbers in coming years. The standard deviation suggests that 67% countries will see change of 0% rise to 100% and that is normal according to the data. \n",
